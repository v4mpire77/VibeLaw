# Character Placeholder Sprites

These 32x32 8-bit inspired sprite sheets are temporary assets generated via
`tools/generate_character_sprites.py`. Each sheet contains four directional
rows (down, up, left, right) with two walking frames per direction. Replace
these with production-ready art once available. Keep this README updated with
provenance details for any future asset swaps.
