# Story 1.2 Playtest Notes

- Build launched via `dotnet run --project VibeLaw.Game`.
- Character select screen shows Omar and Maham portraits with highlight frame and navigation via Arrow/WASD.
- Enter confirmation triggers a short flash before transitioning to the training ground.
- Prototype arena clamps movement within the boundary rectangle; movement tested with both Arrow and WASD inputs.
- Directional animations swap frames while walking; idle pose reflects last faced direction.
- Rapid Enter presses on the selection screen no longer skip content or reload the scene.
