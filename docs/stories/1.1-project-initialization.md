# Story 1.1: Project Initialization
**Status:** Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to establish a clean, consolidated, and buildable MonoGame project foundation,
**so that** all future development is based on a stable and correct repository structure with passing CI.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The GitHub repository is cleaned up to match the "Target State" in the Architecture document (all root-level C# project files are removed).
2. The CI workflow at `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` is updated to target the `VibeLaw.Game/` project exclusively.
3. The sharded `prd.md` and `architecture.md` documents are present in a `/docs` folder in the repository root.
4. The `VibeLaw.Game/` project can be built successfully locally using the `dotnet build --project VibeLaw.Game` command.
5. A GitHub Actions build completes successfully, triggered by a push to the main branch, and produces the expected Windows zip artifact.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Repository Cleanup**
  - [ ] Use `git rm` to remove the following files from the repository root: `Game1.cs`, `Icon.bmp`, `Icon.ico`, `Program.cs`, `VibeLaw.csproj`, `app.manifest`.
  - [ ] Commit the changes with the message: `chore: Remove root project files to consolidate on VibeLaw.Game`.
- [ ] **Update CI Workflow**
  - [ ] Modify the `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` file.
  - [ ] Ensure all `dotnet build` and `dotnet publish` steps explicitly target the subproject using the `--project VibeLaw.Game` flag.
  - [ ] Commit the changes with the message: `ci: Update workflow to target VibeLaw.Game project`.
- [ ] **Add Documentation**
  - [ ] Create a new folder named `docs` in the repository root.
  - [ ] Place the sharded planning documents inside the `/docs` folder.
  - [ ] Commit the documentation files with the message: `docs: Add initial planning baseline documents`.
- [ ] **Validation**
  - [ ] Run `dotnet build --project VibeLaw.Game` locally to confirm the project still builds.
  - [ ] Push all changes to the main branch.
  - [ ] Navigate to the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository and confirm the CI run triggered by your push completes successfully.
  - [ ] Verify that the run produced a named zip file as a build artifact.

## Dev Notes
The primary goal of this story is to align the existing repository with the official architecture. All development must proceed from this cleaned state.
